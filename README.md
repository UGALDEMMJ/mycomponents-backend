# mycomponents-backend

Backend for the myComponents app — a lightweight API built with Deno and oak to serve and manage components for the myComponents frontend.

## Description

mycomponents-backend provides a small, fast, and secure REST API for managing components used by the myComponents application. Built with Deno and oak, it aims to be minimal and easy to run locally or deploy to any Deno-compatible platform.

Main features
- RESTful endpoints to create, read, update, and delete components
- JSON-based API for easy frontend integration
- Lightweight Deno + oak stack for performance and low friction
- Environment-driven configuration for flexible deployments

This repository contains the backend service only. It is intended to be paired with the myComponents frontend.

## Tech Stack

- Runtime: Deno (TypeScript)
- Web framework: oak
- Language: TypeScript (100%)
- Typical/optional components (commonly used with Deno projects):
  - Dependency management pattern via `deps.ts`
  - Configuration via environment variables
  - Database: configurable (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite) via Deno database drivers (not prescriptive — check your project files)

## Prerequisites

- Deno (recommended: latest stable release). Install from https://deno.land/#installation
- A database or persistence layer if your deployment uses one (Postgres, SQLite, etc.)
- Node/npm is NOT required

## Installation (Local Development)

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/UGALDEMMJ/mycomponents-backend.git
   cd mycomponents-backend

2. Inspect and install dependencies (Deno fetch will run on first execution)
   - Deno fetches remote dependencies automatically. Optionally run:
     deno cache ./mod.ts
     (replace `mod.ts` with the project entry point if different)

3. Create environment configuration
   - Create a `.env` file or set environment variables in your environment. Example variables commonly used:

     PORT=8000
     DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/mycomponents
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
     NODE_ENV=development

   - If your project uses a different configuration pattern (e.g., `config.ts` or `config/`), follow the files inside the repo.

4. Recommended: Use a Deno configuration file (deno.json or deno.jsonc) to centralize permissions and tasks. If your repo provides one, follow it.

## Usage

Start the server (example commands — adjust if your repository uses a different entry point):

- Direct run
  deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --unstable mod.ts
  (Replace `mod.ts` with the actual entry file, e.g. `src/main.ts`)

- Using cached dependencies
  deno cache mod.ts
  deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --unstable mod.ts

- If your repository contains a `deno.json` with tasks, you can run:
  deno task start

Access the API:
- Open your browser or API client at http://localhost:8000 (or the port defined in your PORT env var)
- Example endpoints (adjust to actual routes implemented in the project):
  - GET /components
  - POST /components
  - GET /components/:id
  - PUT /components/:id
  - DELETE /components/:id

Notes
- Adjust required Deno permissions (e.g., --allow-net, --allow-read, --allow-write) according to what the app needs.
- If the app uses a database, ensure the database is running and DATABASE_URL is set.

## Folder Structure (typical / recommended)

Below is a simple, common layout for a Deno + oak backend. If your repository differs, follow the code within this repo.

- mod.ts                 — Application entry point (commonly)
- deps.ts                — Centralized dependency exports (recommended)
- src/
  - controllers/         — Request handlers
  - routes/              — Route definitions
  - services/            — Business logic and data access
  - db/                  — Database setup, migrations, models
  - middleware/          — Oak middlewares (auth, logging, error handling)
- tests/                 — Unit and integration tests
- deno.json(.c)          — Deno configuration and task scripts
- .env.example           — Example environment variables

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing! Suggested guidelines:

- Fork the repository and create feature branches from main:
  git checkout -b feat/your-feature

- Keep commits small and focused. Use clear commit messages.

- Open a pull request describing:
  - What you changed
  - Why it is needed
  - Any migration or configuration changes required

- Code style
  - Use TypeScript idioms and prefer small, well-tested functions
  - If a linter/formatter is included (e.g., deno fmt), run it before committing:
    deno fmt
  - Add or update tests in the `tests/` folder where applicable

- CI & tests
  - If adding features, include tests and ensure they pass locally before opening a PR.
