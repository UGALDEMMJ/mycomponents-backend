# mycomponents-backend

This repository contains the backend for the **myComponents** app, built with [Deno](https://deno.com/) and [Oak](https://deno.land/x/oak). The backend is developed in TypeScript and provides RESTful APIs and data management for the myComponents application.

## Features

- Fast and secure backend with Deno runtime
- API routes managed using Oak middleware
- Written in TypeScript for type safety
- Modular structure for scalability and maintainability
